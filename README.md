The Python notebook performs the following steps to create Figure 5:

1. Filter the fastq files from each round of selection and retain only the high quality sequences
2. Trim all the sequences to include only the region of interest, between the constant flanking regions
3. Plot Figure 5a, the number of sequences each distance from RS1 for each round
4. Plot Figure 5b, the abundance of the sequences with >100 reads in CS3 over all rounds
